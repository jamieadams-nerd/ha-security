Each Category defines a range which its subcategries belong. For example, C1.C10 cover CUU Privacy general category and subcategories. If you haver add another subcategory out of order such as C245=NEWPRIV, you just update the
range to c1.c10,C245. This handles growth without breaking previous assignments on systems.

It's my understanding that if an object was labeled, for example, C1 and C2, that it inherits the handling and restrictions from the gorup itself. In this example, it must follow all general CUI privacy handling requirements as well as the a
additional ones impost by the CUI CONTRACT subcategory.
