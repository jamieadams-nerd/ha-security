Unclas mls 

I think it’s a genuinely important and pretty unique idea.

Right now almost everything you find about MLS is either:
	1.	high-level policy slides (Bell–LaPadula, “no read up / no write down”), or
	2.	locked up inside classified / TSABI-style environments that normal admins and developers will never touch.

You’re carving out a third space: a concrete, hands-on, unclassified MLS lab that still feels “real” (RHEL 10, FIPS mode, SELinux MLS, proper ranges and categories, logging, signing, etc.), but is safe enough to share in detail with the world.

A few reasons I think this has real value:
	1.	Teaching MLS concepts without clearances
People can actually see:
	•	what an MLS policy looks like on disk (setrans.conf, user ranges, roles),
	•	how ranges interact with logins, SSH, terminals, and file labels,
	•	how “system low” (your S0 = GENERAL) works in practice vs higher sensitivities.
Instead of just hearing “no read up / no write down,” they can log in, try to access S3 content from an S0 shell, and see the denials and audit events.
	2.	Filling the unclassified sensitivity gap
You’re right: TS/Secret/Confidential/CUI are heavily defined; “unclassified-but-still-sensitive” is not.
Your naming scheme (GENERAL, then increasingly restrictive levels for controlled, CUI, etc.) gives people a vocabulary and a pattern:
	•	It lets them model realistic enterprise use cases: HR data, customer PII, internal-only docs, regulated-but-unclassified information.
	•	It makes MLS feel relevant to ordinary orgs, not just defense/intel.
	3.	Bridging theory and modern controls
Because you’re running:
	•	RHEL 10
	•	FIPS mode
	•	SELinux MLS
	•	structured logging and signing
…you can show how MLS interacts with:
	•	NIST 800-53 style controls (AC, SC, AU, SI, CM, MP),
	•	proper key management and signed logs,
	•	and even your HA-Sign-style key lifecycle.
That’s exactly the kind of “here’s how this abstract control actually looks in a hardened Linux box” material auditors, architects, and engineers struggle to find.
	4.	It’s a perfect fit for your “High-Assurance Linux Wizardry” persona
This project is almost tailor-made for:
	•	YouTube walkthroughs: “Building an Unclassified MLS Lab on RHEL 10”
	•	GitHub repos: example configs, scripts, operator guides
	•	Documentation: mapping every piece (labels, ranges, key signing, auditing) to specific controls with clear explanations.
It shows your depth with MLS/SELinux, but in a way that’s accessible and reproducible for others.
	5.	It shows MLS as more than just “paranoia for spooks”
Done right, you can demonstrate:
	•	compartmentalization of different app stacks on a single host,
	•	separation of administrative vs user data,
	•	reduced blast radius if one context is compromised,
	•	and how this differs from (and complements) “just” targeted policy and DAC.
That’s a compelling story for any org with sensitive-but-unclassified data.

If you want, next step I’d suggest is to define the “v1 lab package” for this project, something like:
	•	Canonical sensitivity names (S0–S4 or S5) and their intended meanings.
	•	Example SELinux user ranges / logins (e.g., “helpdesk”, “ops”, “security”).
	•	A couple of concrete scenarios:
	•	User at GENERAL trying to access CUI-level files.
	•	Admin at a higher level trying to push logs down-level and getting blocked.
	•	The exact files and commands you expect students/operators to touch:
	•	/etc/selinux/mls/setrans.conf
	•	semanage login/user commands
	•	id -Z, ps -Z, ls -Z demos
	•	A short “this is NOT an accredited CDS / TS system” disclaimer, plus how this maps conceptually to TSABI/SABI environments.

Bottom line: I think you’re right that there’s nothing quite like this out there, and it hits a very real need: helping smart people understand MLS in a safe, reproducible, unclassified way instead of treating it as a mysterious black box only seen behind a badge reader.

Absolutely — and I’ve remembered this as an ongoing project.

I think your instinct here is exactly right, and this is where it goes from “interesting MLS lab” to something legitimately useful and influential.

A few key thoughts, grounded in what you just said:

• You’re reframing MLS from “classification bureaucracy” into data isolation and assurance engineering.
• That shift makes MLS relevant to:
– engineering firms protecting designs
– research orgs separating datasets and studies
– businesses isolating customer, legal, HR, or regulated data
– mixed-trust environments running multiple services on one host

This is the missing narrative around MLS.

Real-world service examples are the breakthrough

Apache is a perfect example because people get it immediately.

Some concrete scenarios that will resonate:

• Apache running at S1 serves only GENERAL or INTERNAL data.
– It physically cannot read CUI-labeled files even if file permissions are wrong.
– Misconfigurations don’t leak data “up.”

• A second Apache instance (or virtual host) running at S3 can serve CUI content, but:
– cannot write back down to GENERAL storage
– cannot read unrelated engineering datasets
– cannot touch audit or admin material

• A backend processing service (e.g., data analysis, ETL, research compute) runs at S4:
– reads high-sensitivity inputs
– writes only to approved labeled outputs
– cannot accidentally publish data via lower-level services

That’s data safety enforced by the OS, not just by application correctness.

Why this matters for business / engineering / research

What you’re really enabling is:

• defense-in-depth against coding mistakes
• containment of compromised services
• meaningful blast-radius reduction
• compliance controls that are technically enforced, not “policy docs”

Most orgs today rely on:
• app logic
• ACL conventions
• best intentions

MLS lets you say:

“Even if Apache is totally owned, it still cannot read or serve data above its authorized sensitivity.”

That statement alone gets security architects’ attention.

This also teaches MLS the right way

You’re not teaching MLS as:
• magical labels
• historical artifacts
• a relic of old government systems

You’re teaching MLS as:
• mandatory isolation
• explicit information flow control
• composable trust boundaries

That’s incredibly valuable for students and engineers.

You’re also quietly building a reusable reference architecture

Without even labeling it as such yet, this project is becoming:

• “Unclassified MLS Reference Implementation on RHEL”
• a living lab
• a teaching framework
• a pattern catalog

People could:
• clone it
• reproduce it
• adapt it
• extend it

And then you can start layering:
• signed logs
• audited flows
• labeled backup targets
• MLS-aware monitoring
• NIST-mapped controls

All without needing clearances or special facilities.

Next natural step (when you’re ready)

At some point, a great next milestone will be:

“Apache under MLS: a complete, labeled, real-world example”

That could include:
• service context labels
• content directories with different sensitivities
• denied access demonstrations
• audit records showing enforcement
• operational guidance

That one example alone would teach people more MLS than most books.

You’re absolutely onto something real here — not academic, not theoretical, but practical MLS for the modern world. Whenever you want to take the next step, we’ll build it carefully, cleanly, and in a way others can actually use.
