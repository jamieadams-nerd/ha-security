We can talk about this safely and at a high, structural level. What you’re asking about is personnel clearances, information classifications, and access programs—and those are often conflated. I’ll separate them cleanly and keep it unclassified and accurate.

⸻

1. Two different things people mix up

First, the most important distinction:
	1.	Personnel security clearance
→ what a person is eligible to access
	2.	Information classification / control system
→ how information is marked, protected, and compartmented

You need both:
	•	an appropriate clearance level, and
	•	an explicit need-to-know / access approval

⸻

2. Information classification hierarchy (broad, unclassified view)

U.S. classification levels (information)

From lowest to highest:

• Unclassified (U)
• Confidential (C)
• Secret (S)
• Top Secret (TS)

That’s the basic classification ladder.

These apply in what you’re calling the “General Service” world (often just called collateral classified information).

So you can have:
	•	Confidential collateral
	•	Secret collateral
	•	Top Secret collateral

No compartments yet—just classification level.

⸻

3. SCI is not a clearance level

This is the most common misunderstanding.

SCI (Sensitive Compartmented Information) is not a clearance.
It is an access control system applied on top of Top Secret.

Key rule:

You must already hold a Top Secret clearance to even be considered for SCI access.

SCI is about how information is compartmented, not about how “high” it is on the ladder.

So:
	•	TS is a clearance level
	•	SCI is a handling and access regime

⸻

4. How SCI actually works (high level)

SCI information is divided into compartments.

A person may be:
	•	TS-cleared
	•	But not read into any SCI
	•	Or read into one compartment but not another

This is where you see markings like:
	•	TS//SCI//[CODEWORD]

Each codeword represents a compartment.

Important:
	•	Having SCI access to one program does not grant access to all SCI.
	•	Access is explicit, documented, and need-to-know based.

⸻

5. SAP vs SCI (briefly, because people confuse these)

Another layer you may see:

• SAP (Special Access Program)
• SCI

They are different systems, though similar in spirit.

High-level distinction:
	•	SCI is primarily an Intelligence Community control system
	•	SAPs are often DoD / program-specific special access controls

Both:
	•	Sit on top of Secret or Top Secret
	•	Require explicit indoctrination
	•	Are not implied by clearance alone

You can have:
	•	TS without SCI
	•	TS with SCI
	•	TS with SAP
	•	TS with both (rare, tightly controlled)

⸻

6. Background investigations: SBI, SSBI, etc.

This is the other axis you’re asking about.

Historically (terms evolved over time):

• NAC / ANACI – lower-level investigations
• SBI / SSBI – higher-level investigations

Key point:

The investigation qualifies you for eligibility; it does not grant access.

SSBI (Single Scope Background Investigation)

Traditionally required for:
	•	Top Secret eligibility
	•	SCI eligibility

SBI (Special Background Investigation)

You may see this term used in some postings or legacy language, but in practice:
	•	SCI eligibility requires a TS-level investigation
	•	Today, investigations are largely standardized under:
	•	Tier 5 (T5) investigations

So when a posting says:

“SCI eligible / SBI required”

What it usually means is:
	•	You must be eligible for Top Secret
	•	With an investigation sufficient to support SCI access
	•	Actual SCI access depends on program read-in

⸻

7. “Security clearance required: SCI eligible” — what that really means

In modern job postings, this typically translates to:

• Must be TS-cleared or TS-eligible
• Must have (or be able to obtain) an SCI-qualifying investigation
• Actual SCI access granted only after assignment and approval

It does not mean:
	•	You automatically have SCI
	•	You can access all compartments
	•	Your prior SCI carries over automatically

SCI access is:
	•	Program-specific
	•	Time-bound
	•	Revocable independently of your clearance

⸻

8. The practical hierarchy (people vs data)

Here’s a clean mental model you can keep:

Personnel side (eligibility)
	•	No clearance
	•	Secret clearance
	•	Top Secret clearance

Data side (what exists)
	•	Confidential
	•	Secret
	•	Top Secret
	•	Top Secret + SCI compartments
	•	Top Secret + SAP compartments

Access reality

Clearance sets the ceiling.
Compartments and need-to-know decide the room you’re allowed into.

⸻

9. Why this matters for your UMRS / MLS thinking

What you’re describing maps very closely to MLS concepts:

• Clearance level → dominance (S0 < S1 < S2 …)
• Compartments → categories
• SCI codewords → category sets
• Read-in → authorization decision beyond label dominance

Which is why your intuition about:
	•	MLS
	•	compartments
	•	dominance
	•	categories
is spot on.

In fact, SCI is one of the real-world inspirations for classic MLS systems.

⸻

10. Safe summary you can reuse verbatim

You might like this phrasing:

In the U.S. system, personnel clearances (Secret, Top Secret) establish eligibility ceilings, while access control systems such as SCI and SAP impose additional compartmented restrictions on specific information. SCI is not a clearance level; it is a control system applied to Top Secret information, with access granted only through explicit read-in and need-to-know determinations.

That sentence is accurate, unclassified, and professionally phrased.

⸻

If you want next, we can:
	•	Map SCI concepts directly to SELinux MLS terms (labels, dominance, categories)
	•	Talk about how declassification and downgrading work at a conceptual level
	•	Or contrast classified MLS vs modern unclassified CUI handling (which is exactly where UMRS lives)

You’re navigating this correctly and carefully.


This is a very reasonable idea, and yes—you can do it safely without raising eyebrows, without confusing people, and without drifting into anything sensitive, if you do it deliberately and conservatively.

What you’re proposing already aligns with how training systems, labs, and vendor demos are done in the real world.

Below is the safe, professional way to do it.

⸻

Short answer

Yes, you can build an MLS-style system using classification labels and fake compartments for training and learning, provided you:
	1.	Never use real classified terms, codewords, or program names
	2.	Clearly mark everything as TRAINING / DEMO / SIMULATED
	3.	Use neutral or fictional terminology
	4.	Avoid mimicking real markings too closely
	5.	Document intent clearly and repeatedly

If you do those things, this is not unusual, not risky, and not eyebrow-raising.

⸻

Why this is actually common

Many environments already do this:

• Vendor MLS demos
• Academic MLS research systems
• Government contractor training labs
• STIG / SELinux MLS reference platforms
• Red Team / Blue Team exercises

They never use real SCI codewords or live programs.
They use fictional labels that behave the same way.

You’re proposing the same thing—just thoughtfully.

⸻

The real risks (and how to avoid them)

Risk 1: Using real classification markings

Avoid:
• TS//SCI//REAL-CODEWORD
• Anything that looks like a real compartment
• Real program names, acronyms, or agencies

Even if fictional, that’s where confusion starts.

Risk 2: Accidental authority signaling

If something looks official, people may misinterpret it.

Avoid:
• Exact NARA/CAPCO marking formats
• Exact banner text
• Anything that looks like an operational system

Risk 3: “Cargo cult” classification

If learners can’t tell what’s real vs simulated, training backfires.

Solution:
• Explicit disclaimers
• Modified terminology
• Visual and textual cues that this is a model

⸻

The recommended safe pattern (this is the key)

1. Rename the classification ladder

Instead of:
• Confidential / Secret / Top Secret

Use something like:
• Level 0 / Level 1 / Level 2 / Level 3
• Public / Restricted / Controlled / High-Control
• Blue / Green / Amber / Red

This avoids real-world equivalence while preserving dominance.

Example:
• L0 < L1 < L2 < L3

That maps perfectly to MLS dominance without confusion.

⸻

2. Replace “codewords” with neutral categories

Instead of:
• SCI compartments
• Codewords

Use:
• Domains
• Projects
• Data Classes
• Training Categories

Examples:
• PROJECT_ATLAS
• PROJECT_ORION
• DATA_FINANCE
• DATA_HEALTH
• DATA_RESEARCH

These behave exactly like SCI compartments in MLS terms—but are clearly fictional.

⸻

3. Use explicit “training-only” language everywhere

This is important—and professional.

Put this in:
• README
• system banners
• documentation headers
• diagrams
• UI footers
• example labels

Recommended wording (feel free to reuse):

This system uses simulated classification labels and fictional categories for training and educational purposes only. It does not represent real classified systems, programs, or access controls.

That single sentence solves 90% of concerns.

⸻

4. Avoid real marking syntax

Do not use:

TS//SCI//XYZ
SECRET//NOFORN
CAPCO-style banners

Instead, use a modified, obvious format, for example:

• TRAINING-L3[PROJECT_ATLAS+DATA_RESEARCH]
• SIM-L2(DATA_FINANCE)
• UMRS-L3::ORION+ATLAS

This makes it visually clear it is not real-world marking syntax.

⸻

How this maps perfectly to SELinux MLS (cleanly)

Your system could look like:

• Sensitivities:
	•	umrs_l0
	•	umrs_l1
	•	umrs_l2
	•	umrs_l3

• Categories:
	•	cat_atlas
	•	cat_orion
	•	cat_finance
	•	cat_health

• Human-readable translations:
	•	Level 3 + ATLAS + FINANCE
	•	Training Level 2 + ORION

This is pedagogically excellent:
• dominance is clear
• categories are visible
• no classified semantics implied

⸻

This will not raise eyebrows if…

✔ You never claim it models real programs
✔ You never use real markings
✔ You document intent clearly
✔ You treat it as a reference system
✔ You keep it openly educational

In fact, framed correctly, it looks responsible, not risky.

⸻

How I would describe it publicly (safe phrasing)

Here is a description you could safely use on GitHub, YouTube, or documentation:

This project implements a simulated multi-level security (MLS) reference system using fictional classification levels and categories for training and educational purposes. The labels and policies are intentionally non-operational and do not correspond to real classified markings or access programs. The goal is to demonstrate MLS concepts, dominance, and compartmentalization in a safe, unclassified environment.

That language is solid.

⸻

Final reassurance

What you are proposing is:
• technically sound
• professionally common
• legally safe
• ethically responsible

And frankly:

It is one of the best ways to teach MLS concepts without touching real classified material.

If you want, next we can:
• Design a full fictional label registry (levels + categories)
• Draft a standard disclaimer block you can reuse everywhere
• Map the fictional system directly to SELinux policy examples
• Help you choose names that are obviously fictional but still intuitive

You’re thinking about this exactly the right way.
