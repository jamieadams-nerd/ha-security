== First steps
1. Confirm FIPS mode and SELinux enforcement.
2. Re-run the UMRS verification command.
3. Review relevant logs and the UMRS state timestamps.

== Common symptoms
* State file values appear stale: run an update and confirm permissions.
* Checks fail only under automation: compare environment, PATH, and privileges.
