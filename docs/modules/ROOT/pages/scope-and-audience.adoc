= Scope and Audience

This document describes the design, configuration, integration, and operation of the Unclassified MLS Reference System (UMRS). It is intended to explain how mandatory handling labels are defined, enforced, preserved, and audited on unclassified systems using operating system–level controls and selected enterprise service integrations.

The document focuses on architectural intent and enforcement behavior rather than prescriptive organizational policy. It is written to support understanding, evaluation, and correct deployment of UMRS in environments where unclassified information nonetheless carries mandatory handling requirements.

== Intended Audience

This document is intended for the following audiences:

* System architects and engineers responsible for designing secure Linux-based platforms requiring mandatory access control.
* System administrators responsible for installing, configuring, and operating UMRS-enabled systems.
* Security engineers and assessors evaluating enforcement mechanisms, label handling, and auditability.
* Auditors and reviewers seeking to understand how handling requirements are preserved and evidenced within unclassified environments.

Readers are expected to be familiar with Linux system administration concepts. Familiarity with SELinux, access control models, and security auditing is beneficial but not strictly required.


== In-Scope Capabilities and Responsibilities

UMRS explicitly addresses the following areas, which are considered in scope for both the system and this documentation:

* Unclassified systems requiring mandatory handling markings, such as controlled unclassified information (CUI), privacy-related data, proprietary information, or similar handling regimes.
* Definition and management of human-readable handling labels and their mapping to system-enforced representations.
* Although less lofty goal, Mandatory enforcement of access control using SELinux MLS or MCS mechanisms.
* Label-driven separation of data and services at the operating system and filesystem levels.
* Preservation of handling labels within the system and across controlled egress paths.
* Integration with selected enterprise services, including web serving, electronic mail, and file sharing, to maintain label continuity during data access and transmission.
* Auditability of label assignment, enforcement decisions, and data movement.
* Generation of operational and audit evidence demonstrating system posture and enforcement behavior.
* Least-privilege system design, including controlled delegation of administrative capabilities.

Finally, UMRS is responsible for ensuring that handling requirements are consistently represented, enforced, and observable within its defined operational boundaries.


== Out-of-Scope Capabilities and Non-Goals

The following capabilities and responsibilities are intentionally out of scope for UMRS and are not addressed by this document:

* Classified system operation, accreditation, or enforcement.
* Cross-domain solutions performing content inspection, sanitization, or transformation.
* Determination of whether data is authorized for release or dissemination.
* Content-based data loss prevention or user behavior monitoring.
* Endpoint detection, antivirus, or malware prevention capabilities.
* Network perimeter enforcement, including firewalls, intrusion detection, or intrusion prevention systems.
* Client-side enforcement on unmanaged or external systems.
* Establishment of trust relationships with external organizations or partner environments.
* Replacement of encryption infrastructure or organizational security policy.

UMRS does not attempt to prevent all forms of data leakage. Instead, it ensures that handling requirements are preserved, enforced, and auditable within the system and during supported egress paths.


== Relationship to Other Security Controls

UMRS is designed to complement, not replace, existing organizational security controls. It assumes the presence of baseline system hardening, network protections, and encryption practices appropriate to the deployment environment.

The system focuses specifically on mandatory handling enforcement and label continuity, providing mechanisms that are often absent or inconsistently implemented in unclassified environments.


== Scope Summary

In summary, UMRS provides a reference architecture for enforcing and preserving mandatory handling labels on unclassified systems using operating system–level controls and enterprise service integration. It defines clear enforcement boundaries and produces auditable evidence of system behavior, while deliberately avoiding responsibilities better handled by other security technologies or organizational processes.
