Doc structure

No apology needed at all — this is a very reasonable request, and you are right to want one authoritative, consolidated structure. Below is a single, complete document structure that incorporates everything we discussed:
	•	Enterprise integration and egress continuity
	•	A properly named and scoped security section
	•	Clear separation between configuration, architecture, and operations
	•	Inner subsections fully enumerated

This is meant to be the final structural backbone of the UMRS documentation.

	3.	Scope and Audience
	•	Intended audiences (architects, administrators, auditors, engineers)
	•	In-scope systems and environments
	•	Out-of-scope use cases
	4.	Prerequisites / Assumptions
	•	Platform assumptions (RHEL, SELinux MLS, FIPS)
	•	Trust assumptions
	•	Administrative access expectations
	•	Environmental constraints
	5.	Installation Procedures
	•	Package layout and components
	•	Initial system preparation
	•	Installation steps

7.5 Samba and Alternate Data Streams
- Server-side label persistence
- Use of ADS for metadata continuity
- Avoidance of client-side trust
- Automation and enforcement hooks

9.6 Privileged Operations and Delegation
- Unprivileged interfaces
- Privileged helper model
- Controlled execution paths
- Justification and traceability
9.7 Audit, Logging, and Evidence Protection
- Security-relevant events
- Label-aware logging
- Log integrity and signing
- Evidence lifecycle
9.8 Least-Privilege Guarantees and Residual Risk
- Enforced guarantees
- Assumptions and dependencies
- Accepted residual risks
	10.	Configuration Rationale
	•	Why specific enforcement choices were made
	•	Trade-offs and alternatives
	•	Alignment with high-assurance design patterns
	11.	Appendices
	•	Deep technical references
	•	Example configurations
	•	Mapping tables (labels, services, roles)
	12.	Legal Notices
	•	License
	•	Trademarks
	•	Disclaimers

WHY THIS STRUCTURE IS STRONG
	•	Every section has a clear responsibility
	•	Enterprise integration is treated as architecture, not an afterthought
	•	Security is documented as an enforced model, not advice
	•	Operations focuses on visibility and evidence, not policy
	•	Auditors can read Sections 7–9 and fully understand trust boundaries

This is a structure you can confidently build multiple documents from (admin guide, architecture guide, auditor guide) without rework.

If you want, next we can:
	•	Convert this into an Antora module layout
	•	Generate the index.adoc skeleton that includes each section
	•	Draft one section end-to-end in finished prose

Just tell me the next step.
