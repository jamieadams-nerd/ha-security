== Purpose
UMRS exists to demonstrate that “unclassified but sensitive” data deserves structured enforcement, not just login-based access control.

== Core principles
* Labeling: data is associated with labels/categories.
* Enforcement: services and users are confined so they can only access labeled data they are authorized to handle.
* Auditability: important events are recorded in a way that supports forensics and accreditation evidence.

== Non-goals
UMRS is not a classified system. UMRS is a reference pattern and teaching platform.
